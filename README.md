# Incident-Response-Plan
This is an Incident Response Plan designed for organizations to handle cybersecurity incidents.
It outlines clear steps to identify, respond to, and recover from potential threats like data breaches, malware attacks, or phishing scams. This document is practical and adaptable, meant to showcase how to create and manage an effective response plan.

Incident Response Plan

1. Preparation

The preparation phase ensures your team is ready to handle incidents before they occur.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Train all employees to recognize common threats (phishing emails, suspicious links, etc.).
	•	Set up monitoring tools to detect unusual activity.
	•	Create a list of emergency contacts, like IT staff and third-party security vendors.
	•	Develop a backup system for all critical data.

2. Identification

In this step, the team determines whether an incident has occurred.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Monitor logs, alerts, and reports for signs of a security breach.
	•	Verify the nature of the incident (ex: malware, phishing, unauthorized access).
	•	Document all findings, including timestamps, affected systems, and potential entry points.

3. Containment

The focus here is to prevent the incident from spreading.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Isolate affected systems by disconnecting them from the network.
	•	Block suspicious IP addresses and change compromised passwords.
	•	Notify team members and stakeholders about the issue to avoid further damage.

4. Eradication

This step involves removing the cause of the incident.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Scan affected systems for malware and delete malicious files.
	•	Apply patches and updates to close security vulnerabilities.
	•	Conduct a root-cause analysis to understand how the incident occurred.

5. Recovery

The goal here is to restore normal operations safely.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Restore affected systems using clean backups.
	•	Test systems to ensure there are no lingering issues.
	•	Monitor the environment for signs of reinfection or further attacks.

6. Lessons Learned

This phase helps improve the IRP by analyzing the incident and the response process.
	•	Key Actions:
	•	Hold a meeting with the response team to discuss what went well and what didn’t.
	•	Update the IRP to address gaps or improve efficiency.
	•	Train employees based on lessons learned from the incident.

Tools Used
	•	Antivirus Software: To detect and remove malware.
	•	Network Monitoring Tools: To identify unusual activity.
	•	Backup Solutions: To recover lost or corrupted data.

Goals of This IRP
	1.	Minimize damage during a security incident.
	2.	Restore normal operations as quickly as possible.
	3.	Improve security to prevent future incidents.

How to Use This Plan
	1.	Download the plan as a reference document for your organization.
	2.	Customize it based on your company’s needs and structure.
	3.	Train your team on these steps so everyone knows their role during an incident.
